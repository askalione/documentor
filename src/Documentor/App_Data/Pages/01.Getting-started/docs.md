## Welcome to Documentor’s documentation!

Extremly light and easy to use flat file CMS on [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0) for build software documentation. 

It's used [Makdown](https://www.markdownguide.org)  (lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax) as a format for writing content.

Latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/askalione/documentor/releases/latest).

### Requirements

* .NET 7 or later - [download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0).
* Don't be lobster.

It’s recommended to use [XDocumentor](https://github.com/askalione/xdocumentor) for automatic documents generation in Markdown format from Xml-comments in your *.dll.
